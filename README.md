# quantum_tiq_taq_toe
Quantum Tic Tac Toe is a unique spin on the classic tic tac toe game. It differs from the classic version of
the game courtesy of the superposition rule which is essentially the crux of the game. Rather than having
a discrete position for a particular X or O, each of the two can be in two different squares simultaneously
until the outcome of the game is measured; at which point the superposition collapses and one of the two
chosen squares hosts the symbol. Each state in the game can either be an entangled state or a non-entangled
one.
